          themselves - making you more productive, and less stressed, and adding just a bit more joy into your
          practice of medicine.

        <p class="command-content">You don't have to click a dozen times to order a flu shot or bounce around five windows to discover the
          last blood count. Canvas pulls everything you need directly into your note, so you never have to leave it.
          And because Canvas learns from every interaction, it gets smarter with ever patient you see.

        <p class="command-content italic">"Canvas works three times as fast, improves performance dramatically on key quality metrics,
          and is incredibly easy to use. The right information is presented in the right way at the right
          time, and the product leverages technology to actually improve the quality of care I provide."

        <p class="command-content">Canvas makes it simple to search and take action across your entire patient panel, so you know
        who needs extra help and how best to give it to them. Easily reach out to any subgroup of your population with proactive interventions,
        and take comfort knowing you're a step ahead. </p>

        <p class="command-content italic">"Which of my uncontrolled diabetic patients haven't had a test in the past 3 months? Which of my patient
        are on potentially unsafe levels of opiods according tot he most recent guidelines? That doesn't seem like a lot to ask and those are tremendously
        important questions. But I cou;dn't get an answer from our old system! Canvas is light-years ahead."</p>

        <h2 class="command-header">It automates performance improvement</h2>
        <p class="command-content">Clinical quality and revenue cycle reports can help you understand performance, but they aren't enough
          to improve quality and increase revenue day after day. Canvas automates quality protocols and charge capture so clinicians
          can focus on more complex work only they can do.

        <p class="command-content italic">"With MIPS a reality and fee-for-service billing rules as complex as ever, to be honest
          I didn't know how we were going to keep up. We're a small practice and we don't have a big quality team or a group of coders
          to catch everything. The automation in Canvas has completely eliminated my concerns around quality and revenue performance."</p>
